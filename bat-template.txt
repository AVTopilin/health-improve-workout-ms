# Windows Batch File Template with Proper Encoding

## Header for all .bat files:
```batch
@echo off
chcp 65001 >nul
```

## What chcp 65001 does:
- Sets console code page to UTF-8
- Allows proper display of special characters
- Fixes Russian text display issues

## Alternative approaches:
1. Use English text in .bat files (recommended)
2. Save .bat files as UTF-8 with BOM
3. Use chcp 1251 for Windows-1251 encoding

## Best practices:
- Always start with chcp 65001 >nul
- Use English text for better compatibility
- Avoid special characters in file names
- Test on different Windows versions

## Example of proper encoding:
```batch
@echo off
chcp 65001 >nul
echo [INFO] Starting service...
echo [OK] Service started successfully
echo [ERROR] Service failed to start
pause
```
